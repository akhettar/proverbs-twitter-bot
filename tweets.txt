1 Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

First used in precisely this form by the British poet and playwright Thomas Haynes Bayly, in his song "Isle of Beauty" (c. 1850). The sentiment can be traced back to the Roman

poet Propertius (1st century ac). 2 Men are best loved furthest off.

3 Absence diminishes little passions and increases great ones.
4 Absence sharpens love, presence strengthens it.
